## About the Video Course
C++ is a flexible and generic language that offers a wide range of benefits with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications. This course is an introductory guide to C++ that will help you learn the language through multiple hands-on examples.
You’ll begin by diving into the C++ basics, syntax, and generic programming features. We’ll then move on to using data structures and algorithms with C++. Next, you’ll delve into the object-oriented features of C++ with another practical example. 
Finally, you’ll further enhance your C++ programming skills by creating multiple GUI, desktop applications using Qt5. By the end of this course, you will have gained knowledge of core programming concepts in C++, and how to implement them effectively.
